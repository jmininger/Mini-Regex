A simple regular expression engine that parses rexeps, converts them into an
NFA(non-deterministic finite automata) and runs it on input strings to find
matches. 

THIS IS AN INCOMPLETE PROJECT
The stack and simulation parts are complete

Patterns supported: 
ab -- union
a|b -- or
a* -- Kleene star
. -- (Metachar)
(ab (c|d)) | e -- nested expressions
